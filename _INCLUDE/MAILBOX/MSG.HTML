    <p><strong>Invitation to Apprenticeship Assessment
    Morning</strong></p>
    <p>Following your application for an Electrical
    Apprenticeship with Clarkson Evans, <P8> branch, I
    am
    delighted to confirm that you have been selected to
    attend an assessment morning at <P3> which will be
    held
    at our <P6> office (

    >click to see map</a>
    ). You should aim to arrive 15 minutes early,
    ready to start at the time above. On arrival,
    please report to the Main Entrance.</p>
    <p><strong>Details</strong></p>
    <p>During the morning you will be asked to complete
    assessments covering Maths, English and practical
    skills. Finally, we will also carry out colour
    blindness
    screening. We anticipate finishing at approximately
    12.15pm.&nbsp;If you have already completed your
    level 3
    in Electrical Installations we will ask you to stay
    and
    complete a short theory test which will take an
    additional 30 minutes.</p>
    <p>We suggest smart casual dress for the assessment
    day
    however as you will be carrying out a practical
    task, it
    is important that you are comfortable and wearing
    sturdy
    footwear. Free on-site parking is usually available,
    but
    you may need to be prepared to park on a roadside
    nearby
    at busy times. Please do not park in any spaces
    where
    signage indicates that they are allocated to
    neighbouring businesses.</p>
