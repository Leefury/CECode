Numbers 
The following expressions are related to numbers: 
 ROUND(m) — rounds m (a real number) to the nearest integer and treats 
it as an integer 
SELECT ROUND(1.45) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 1 */ 
 ROUNDR(m) — rounds m (a real number) to the nearest integer but treats 
it as a real number 
SELECT ROUNDR(1.45) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 1.000000 */ 
 MINOP(m, n) — returns the minimum value between two numbers 
SELECT MINOP(1.5,2) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 1.500000 */ 
 MAXOP(m, n) — returns the maximum value between two numbers 
SELECT MAXOP(1.5,2) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 2.000000 */ 
 EXP(m, n) — treats n as an exponent of m

SELECT EXP(3,2) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 9 */ 
SELECT EXP(2,3) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 8 */ 
 SQRT(m) — returns the square root of m rounded to the nearest integer, 
where m is an integer 
SELECT SQRT(10) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 3 */ 
 SQRTR(m) — returns the square root of m, where m is a real number 
SELECT SQRTR(10.0) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 3.162278 */ 
 ABS(m) — returns the absolute value of m, where m is an integer 
SELECT ABS(-5) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 5 */ 
 ABSR(m) — returns the absolute value of m, where m is a real number 
SELECT ABSR(-5.3) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 5.300000 */ 
 n MOD m — calculates modular arithmetic 
SELECT 10 MOD 4 FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 2 */ 
You can also use the MOD function to retrieve the time from a DATE 14 
variable: 
SELECT 17/05/09 12:25 MOD 24:00 FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 
12:25 */ 
 REALQUANT(m) — inputs a shifted integer and translates it to a real 
number, where the number of places that the decimal point is moved is 
determined by the value of the DECIMAL system constant (usually, 3). Used 
in reports to define a calculated column that, for example, displays 
Quantity x Price, when Quantity is a shifted integer and Price is a real 
number. 
:ORDERITEMS.TQUANT = 1000; 
SELECT REALQUANT(:ORDERITEMS.TQUANT) FROM DUMMY 
FORMAT;  
/* 1.000000 assuming the DECIMAL constant = 3 */ 
 INTQUANT(m) — inputs a real number and translates it to a shifted 
integer, where the number of places that the decimal point is moved is 
determined by the DECIMAL system constant. Used in the form interface 
(Form Load Designer) when the load table is GENERALLOAD, and you want 
to use one of the table columns for quantity as a shifted integer. 
SELECT INTQUANT(1.0) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 1000 assuming 
the DECIMAL constant = 3 */ 
 ITOH(m) — returns the hexadecimal value of m, where m is an integer 
SELECT ITOH(10) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* a */ 
 HTOI(m) — inputs a hexadecimal value and translates it to its 
corresponding integer 
SELECT HTOI(b) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 11 */
