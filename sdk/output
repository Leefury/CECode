Additions and Revisions to Standard SQL Commands 
Priority offers some additional features to several standard SQL commands: 
SELECT, ORDER BY and LIKE. Furthermore, it entails revisions to the standard 
SQL join. 
Output Formats for SELECT 
In Priority, an output format command must be added to the end of a SELECT 
statement in order to obtain output. There are several output format 
commands: 
 FORMAT — generates output comprised of column headings and data. 
 TABS — generates data separated by tabs (\t) with titles of retrieved 
columns at the beginning of each record and line feed (\n) at the end of 
each record; useful for preparing files that can be loaded into a 
spreadsheet.  
Note: To create the file without titles, initialize the :NOTABSTITLE variable to 
1 before executing the query. 
 DATA — generates file structure information (header), marked as comment 
lines by the symbol #, as well as the data; useful for exporting Priority 
data to an external database. 
 ASCII — produces output of data only (no column headings) with no 
spaces in between columns. 
 SQLSERVER — same as TABS, except that output does not include the titles 
of retrieved columns. 
 ORACLE — generates a file for sqlldr (SQL Loader – an Oracle utility used 
to load data from external files). 
 UNICODE — generates output in Unicode (UTF-16) format. 
 ADDTO — adds data to end of specified file, rather than replacing the 
contents of the file. 
The syntax of these commands is: 
SELECT ... [ { FORMAT | TABS | DATA | ASCII | SQLSERVER | 
ORACLE} [UNICODE ] [ ADDTO ] [ 'filename' ] ];
