Outer Join 
An outer join is represented in Priorityâ€™s syntax by a question mark (?) 
following the table ID: 
SELECT ... 
FROM FNCITEMS, FNCITEMSB ? 
WHERE FNCITEMSB.FNCTRANS = FNCITEMS.FNCTRANS 
AND FNCITEMSB.KLINE = FNCITEMS.KLINE; 
As opposed to regular joins, an outer join preserves unmatched rows. Thus, if 
there is no join record, a null record will be retrieved from the join table and 
the query will succeed.
