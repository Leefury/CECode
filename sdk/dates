Dates 
Dates, times and days are stored in the database as integers. Dates may be 
represented to the user in American (MMDDYY) or European (DDMMYY) format, 
depending on the type assigned to the language being used (in the 
Languages form: System Management  Dictionaries  Translation).  
The following examples are in American date format. 
 DAY(date) — yields the number of the weekday on which the specified 
date falls (where Sun=1, Mon=2, etc.). 
SELECT DAY(03/22/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 4 */ 
Note: This number can then be translated into the name of the 
weekday by means of the DAYS table (for the application's base 
language of English) and the LANGDAYS table (for any additional 
languages). These tables store the names of all days in the week in 
what ever language you are using. 
 MDAY(date) — yields the number of the day in the month 
SELECT MDAY(03/22/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 22 */ 
 WEEK(date) — yields an integer comprised of the year (last one or two 
digits of the year) and the number of the week in the year (two digits, 
between 01 and 53) 
SELECT WEEK(03/22/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 612 */ 
 WEEK6(date) — yields an integer comprised of the year in 4 digits and the 
number of the week in the year (two digits, between 01 and 53)

SELECT WEEK6(03/22/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 200612 */ 
 MWEEK(week) — given a value for week (the last two digits of a year and 
the number of a week in that year), yields the number of the month in 
which that week falls 
SELECT MWEEK(0612) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 3 */ 
 MONTH(date) — yields the number of the month in the year 
SELECT MONTH(03/22/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 3 */ 
 QUARTER(date) — yields a string comprised of the annual quarter in 
which the date falls followed by the four digits of the year  
SELECT QUARTER(09/22/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 3Q-2006 
*/ 
 YEAR(date) — yields an integer comprised of the four digits of the year 
SELECT YEAR(03/22/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 2006 */ 
 TIMELOCAL(date) — yields the number of seconds from January 1, 1970, 
to the specified date 
SELECT TIMELOCAL(05/04/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 
1146693600 */ 
 CTIME(int) — yields the date corresponding to the given number of 
seconds since January 1, 1970 02:00 
SELECT CTIME(1146693600) FROM DUMMY FORMAT;  
/* Thu May 04 01:00:00 2006 */ 
 BEGINOFMONTH(date) — yields the date of the first day of the month 
SELECT BEGINOFMONTH(05/04/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 
05/01/06 */ 
 BEGINOFQUARTER(date) — yields the date of the first day of the quarter 
SELECT BEGINOFQUARTER(05/04/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 
04/01/06 */ 
 BEGINOFHALF(date) — yields the date of the first day of the six-month 
period (half a year) in which the date falls 
SELECT BEGINOFHALF(10/22/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 
07/01/06 */ 
 BEGINOFYEAR(date) — yields the date of the first day of the year 
SELECT BEGINOFYEAR(10/22/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 
01/01/06 */ 
 ENDOFMONTH(date) — yields the date of the end of the month 
SELECT ENDOFMONTH(04/22/06) FROM DUMMY FORMAT; /* 
04/30/06 */ 
 ENDOFQUARTER(date) — yields the date of the end of the quarter

 ATOD(date, pattern) — converts dates, times and days into internal 
numbers (mainly used to import external data) 
see usage below 
 DTOA(date, pattern) — converts dates, times and days in the system to 
ASCII (mainly used to print out or display data to the user) 
see usage below 
Pattern Components for ATOD and DTOA Expressions 
The following pattern components can be included in ATOD and DTOA 
expressions (those marked with an asterisk (*) only apply to DTOA). Of course, 
more than one component can be used in the same expression. 
Note: You can add punctuation marks (e.g., dashes, slashes, commas) and 
spaces between pattern components as desired. 
 MMM or mmm — abbreviated form (first three letters) of month name 
(Jan)  
 MMMM or mmmm — full name of the month (January) 
 MONTH — abbreviated form of month name and the last two digits of the 
year (Jun-06)  
 MM — number of the month (01) 
 DD — date in the month (15) 
 YY — last two digits of year (06) 
 YYYY — all four digits of year (2006) 
 day* — weekday (Mon) 
 hh:mm — hours and minutes (12:05) 
 XX/XX/XX — date with two-digit year, displayed in American or European 
format, depending on the language type defined in the Languages form.  
 XX/XX/XXXX — date with four-digit year, displayed in American or 
European format, depending on the language type defined in the 
Languages form. 
 FULLDATE* — the month name (abbreviated form), date and four-digit 
year
